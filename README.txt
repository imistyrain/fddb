1. Original set of images
--------------------------

The original set of images can be downloaded from 
http://tamaraberg.com/faceDataset/originalPics.tar.gz
Uncompressing this file organizes the images as
originalPics/year/month/day/big/*.jpg


2. Face annotations
--------------------------------

Uncompressing the "FDDB-folds.tgz" file creates a directory
"FDDB-folds", which contains files with names:
FDDB-fold-xx.txt and FDDB-fold-xx-ellipseList.txt,
where xx = {01, 02, ..., 10} represents the fold-index.

Each line in the "FDDB-fold-xx.txt" file specifies a path 
to an image in the above-mentioned data set. For instance, 
the entry "2002/07/19/big/img_130" corresponds to 
"originalPics/2002/07/19/big/img_130.jpg."

The corresponding annotations are included in the file 
"FDDB-fold-xx-ellipseList.txt" in the following 
format:

...
<image name i>
<number of faces in this image =im>
<face i1>
<face i2>
...
<face im>
...

Here, each face is denoted by:
<major_axis_radius minor_axis_radius angle center_x center_y 1>.


3. Detection output
--------------------------------

To be recognized by the evaluation code, the detection
output is expected in the following format:

...
<image name i>
<number of faces in this image =im>
<face i1>
<face i2>
...
<face im>
...

where the representation of a face depends on the specifics
of the shape of the hypothesized image region. The evaluation
code supports the following shapes:
  
  4 a. Rectangular regions
       Each face region is represented as:
       <left_x top_y width height detection_score> 
  
  4 b. Elliptical regions
       Each face region is represented as:
       <major_axis_radius minor_axis_radius angle center_x center_y detection_score>.

Also, the order of images in the output file is expected to be 
the same as the order in the file annotatedList.txt.
